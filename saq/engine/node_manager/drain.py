"""Support for draining a node.

A draining node receives no new work but completes the work it already has.
Delayed analysis is the exception: those requests are pinned to the node and
can be scheduled far into the future, so a draining node pushes them to
another node that can accept them. If no compatible node exists the work
stays put (it does not block the drain) and resumes when the node starts back
up.
