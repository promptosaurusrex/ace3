"""Remediation timeline aggregation.

A small, generic mechanism that lets any Analysis subclass publish chronological
"remediation events" (e.g., what an email-security platform did to a message),
and lets the alert UI render them as a unified timeline regardless of which
platform produced them.

Three pieces:
- ``RemediationEvent``: a platform-agnostic record of one event.
- ``RemediationEventProvider``: the duck-typed protocol an Analysis implements
  to contribute events.
- ``gather_remediation_events()``: walks an alert's analysis tree and returns
  all events from all providers, sorted by timestamp ascending.

The aggregator is intentionally tolerant: any provider exception or unparseable
event is logged and skipped so a misbehaving integration cannot prevent the
alert page from rendering.
