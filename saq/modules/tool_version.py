"""Probe external inputs for cache-key ``extended_version`` use.

Many analysis modules shell out to CLI tools whose version participates in
output correctness (OCR uses ``tesseract``; QR decoding uses ``zbarimg``,
``gs``, ``pdfinfo``). When such a module opts into analysis-result caching,
its ``extended_version`` must include those tool versions so a package
upgrade that changes tool behavior invalidates stale cache entries instead
of silently serving replays produced by the old tool.

``probe_binary_version`` resolves the binary the same way ``Popen`` would
(via ``shutil.which``), runs it once, and caches the result keyed on the
resolved path's ``(st_mtime_ns, st_size)`` — so the subprocess runs at most
once per installed binary, and an upgrade (which replaces the file and moves
its mtime) triggers a fresh probe. See docs/ANALYSIS_CACHING.md ("tool-version
helper").

``file_content_version`` covers the other extended_version flavor: a small
backing file (e.g. the QR URL filter) whose *contents* change module output.
It returns a content sha256 — deterministic across hosts, unlike mtime.
