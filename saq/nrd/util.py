"""Helper utilities for the newly-registered-domains (NRD) lookup.

Exposes ``is_newly_registered(domain)`` for analysis modules and other callers
to check whether an FQDN appears in the locally-maintained NRD SQLite
database that ``saq.nrd.refresh`` produces.

A read-only SQLite connection is cached at module level (one per worker
process) and invalidated whenever the database file's mtime changes — so
when the refresh script atomically swaps in a new database, the next call
picks it up automatically. See ``docs/design/newly_registered_domains.md``
for the full design.
