"""URL-click timeline aggregation.

A small, source-agnostic mechanism that lets any Analysis subclass publish "click
events" (a user reaching a URL / visiting a domain, as seen in some log source) and
lets the alert UI render them as a single unified table regardless of which source
(Splunk, Logscale, ...) produced them.

Three pieces, mirroring ``saq.remediation.timeline``:
- ``ClickerEvent``: a source-agnostic record of one observed click.
- ``ClickerEventProvider``: the duck-typed protocol an Analysis implements.
- ``gather_clicker_events()``: walks an alert's analysis tree and returns all events
  from all registered providers, sorted by timestamp ascending.

The aggregator is intentionally tolerant: any provider exception or unparseable event
is logged and skipped so a misbehaving source cannot prevent the alert page from
rendering.
