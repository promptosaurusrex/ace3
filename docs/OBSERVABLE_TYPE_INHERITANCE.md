# Observable type inheritance

Every observable in ACE has a type — `email_address`, `url`, `fqdn`, `file`,
and so on. As of PR #193, observable types can declare a parent type, forming
an inheritance hierarchy. Anywhere ACE asks "is this an `email_address`?", the
answer is now yes for `email_address` itself *and* for every type that
**extends** it (`email_from`, `email_return_path`, `email_to`, ...).

A type's parent is declared in YAML:

```yaml
types:
  email_from:
    extends: email_address
    default_display_type: "Mail From"
    description: "email From: header address"
```

The hierarchy is consulted at three points in ACE:

1. **Analysis-module dispatch.** A module declaring
   `valid_observable_types = F_EMAIL_ADDRESS` automatically also runs on every
   subtype of `email_address`.
2. **`observable_modifier` rule matching.** A rule with
   `observable_types: [email_address]` matches every subtype too.
3. **Display labels.** When no code explicitly sets `obs.display_type = "..."`,
   the observable falls back to the `default_display_type` configured for its
   type in YAML.

## `etc/observable_types.yaml` is the source of truth

### Overriding the file in a deployment

The path is configured by `observable_types.config_path` in
`etc/saq.default.yaml`, and defaults to `etc/observable_types.yaml`.
Production deployments typically override this to a single file of their own
(for example, a file under `signatures/analyst_data/`).

**Important gotcha:** there is no multi-path layering today. A deployment
override **replaces** the built-in file rather than layering on top of it.
If you provide your own observable types YAML, copy `etc/observable_types.yaml`
as a starting point and add your customizations on top — otherwise you will
lose every built-in type entry.

If `observable_types.config_path` is set to an empty string, no YAML is loaded
and the registry stays empty. In that mode, `is_subtype` returns true only for
the self-comparison and there are no default display labels — useful for
isolating tests, but not a normal operating mode.

### Picking up changes at runtime

Registry accessors stat the configured YAML on a debounce and reload it if
the file's mtime has advanced. So edits to the file on disk — for example, a
`git pull` of the signatures repo bringing in a new entry — get picked up by
every running ACE process within a bounded window without an operator
restarting any container.

The cadence is controlled by `observable_types.reload_check_interval_seconds`
in `etc/saq.default.yaml` (default `60.0`). The check is debounced
per-process: at most one `os.stat()` call per worker per interval, regardless
of accessor call rate. A reload that fails (missing file, malformed YAML,
introduces a cycle) leaves the prior in-memory state intact and logs an
error.

Set `reload_check_interval_seconds` to `0` (or any non-positive value) to
disable runtime reload entirely — the registry then loads once at startup
and never refreshes, matching the behavior before this feature shipped.

The `/observable_types/` API endpoint applies its own short TTL cache
(60s by default) on top of the registry, so worst-case staleness for an
analyst hitting the GUI's observable picker is approximately
`reload_check_interval_seconds + cache TTL`. Module dispatch, `display_type`
fallback, and `observable_modifier` rule matching skip the cache layer and
see changes within the reload interval alone.

## Why we built it

### The Mail From / Mail Return Path collision

ACE deduplicates observables by `(type, value)`. Before this change, every
email-address-shaped piece of an email — `From`, `To`, `Cc`, `Reply-To`,
`Return-Path`, the SMTP envelope addresses, and the various `X-*` sender
headers — was added as type `email_address`. When a sender used the same
address in their `From` and `Return-Path` headers (which is very common), the
two were collapsed into a single observable, and analysts lost the ability to
see and act on the Return-Path signal independently.

The fix introduces 11 distinct email subtypes, all extending `email_address`.
Now `Mail From` and `Mail Return Path` carry distinct types and dedup never
collapses them, regardless of value. See the *email subtype tree* further
down.

### Metadata sprawl

Before this change, type metadata lived in three different blocks of
`saq/constants.py` (`OBSERVABLE_DESCRIPTIONS`, `VALID_OBSERVABLE_TYPES`,
`DEPRECATED_OBSERVABLES`) and dozens of `obs.display_type = "..."` setters
sprinkled across email-parsing code. Adding or deprecating a type meant
editing several places at once, and no single source listed every type ACE
knew about. The YAML registry consolidates all of it.

### Module-author burden

When a new email-address-shaped type was needed (for example, a vendor-
specific header), every module that already ran on `email_address` had to be
updated by hand to add the new type to its `valid_observable_types`. Subtype-
aware dispatch removes that step entirely.

## What it lets you do

### Distinguish observables that share a value but mean different things

When an email's `From` and `Return-Path` headers both contain
`alice@example.com`, you now get two observables — one of type `email_from`
with display label `Mail From`, and one of type `email_return_path` with
display label `Mail Return Path` — instead of one collapsed observable. The
same applies across all 11 email subtypes (see the tree below).

### Write analysis modules that target a parent type

A module that wants to run on every email address — regardless of which header
it came from — only has to declare the parent type:

```python
from saq.constants import F_EMAIL_ADDRESS

class MyEmailAddressModule(AnalysisModule):
    @property
    def valid_observable_types(self):
        return F_EMAIL_ADDRESS
```

This module will be dispatched against every observable whose type *is or
extends* `email_address` — including all the new email subtypes, plus any new
ones added later in YAML. No code changes required when a new subtype lands.

If a particular module genuinely requires an exact-type match (for example,
something that should only ever run on the bare `email_address` and never on
the subtypes), set `valid_observable_subtypes = False` on the class:

```python
class StrictEmailAddressModule(AnalysisModule):
    valid_observable_subtypes = False

    @property
    def valid_observable_types(self):
        return F_EMAIL_ADDRESS
```

### Write `observable_modifier` rules that target a parent type

The `observable_modifier` rule conditions are subtype-aware too. A rule like:

```yaml
- name: tag_internal_email_addresses
  conditions:
    observable_types: [email_address]
    value_regex: "@example\\.com$"
  actions:
    add_tags: [internal]
```

…matches `email_address` *and* every subtype (`email_from`,
`email_return_path`, `email_to`, `email_cc`, etc.) without listing them
individually. If you want a rule that only runs on a specific subtype — say,
only on Return-Path observables — list that subtype explicitly:

```yaml
conditions:
  observable_types: [email_return_path]
```

### Define new observable types in YAML without writing Python

Adding a new entry to `etc/observable_types.yaml` (or your deployment's
override file) is enough to make a type fully real:

```yaml
types:
  pdf_file:
    extends: file
    description: "PDF document"
```

Once the change is on disk and the runtime-reload window has elapsed
(see *Picking up changes at runtime* above):

- `pdf_file` is reported by `get_all_valid_types()` and accepted by the `ace`
  CLI's `add-observable` command and the `/observables/types` API.
- Any analysis module declaring `valid_observable_types = F_FILE` will also
  run on `pdf_file` observables.
- Any `observable_modifier` rule targeting `file` will also match `pdf_file`.
- The description shows up in API responses and in the analyst UI's
  observable picker.
- Adding `deprecated: true` on a future date hides it from pickers without
  removing the entry.

The `F_*` Python constant is only required if Python code needs to reference
the type by symbolic name. Hunt rules and observable-modifier rules can refer
to the YAML name directly.

### Get consistent display labels for free

Before this change, getting "Mail Return Path" to appear in the UI for a
Return-Path observable required Python code to call
`obs.display_type = "Mail Return Path"` at every site that created the
observable. Now, setting:

```yaml
email_return_path:
  extends: email_address
  default_display_type: "Mail Return Path"
```

…is enough. Every observable of type `email_return_path` automatically
displays as `Mail Return Path (email_return_path)` unless code explicitly
overrides `display_type`. Explicit setters still win — the YAML default is
only consulted when no setter has run.

## The email subtype tree

All 11 new email subtypes extend `email_address`. The display labels listed
here are configured via `default_display_type` in `etc/observable_types.yaml`
and are what analysts see in the UI.

```
email_address
├── email_from                      ─ "Mail From"
├── email_to                        ─ "Mail To"
├── email_cc                        ─ "Mail CC"
├── email_reply_to                  ─ "Mail Reply To"
├── email_return_path               ─ "Mail Return Path"
├── email_envelope_mail_from        ─ "Envelope Mail From"
├── email_envelope_rcpt_to          ─ "Envelope Recipient"
├── email_x_sender                  ─ "Mail X-Sender"
├── email_x_sender_id               ─ "Mail X-Sender ID"
├── email_x_auth_id                 ─ "Mail X-Auth ID"
└── email_x_original_sender         ─ "Mail X-Original Sender"
```

`email_conversation`, `email_delivery`, `email_subject`, `email_header`,
`email_body`, `email_x_mailer`, and `message_id` are *not* subtypes of
`email_address`; they remain top-level types because their values are not
email addresses.
